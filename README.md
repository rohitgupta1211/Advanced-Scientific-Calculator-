Advanced Scientific Calculator:

This repository contains the source code for an advanced scientific calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The calculator provides a wide range of mathematical functions including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential operations. It also supports advanced features like graph plotting, binary/hexadecimal/decimal conversions, and history tracking.

Features:
*Basic Arithmetic Operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.

*Advanced Mathematical Functions: Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, cot, sec, cosec), logarithms, exponents, square and cube roots.

*Graph Plotting: Plot mathematical functions and visualize graphs.

*Memory Functions: Add to and recall memory.

*History: Store and view a history of previous calculations with full expressions and results.

*Unit Conversions: Convert between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal.

*Theme Toggle: Switch between light and dark mode for a better user experience.

Technologies Used:

*Python: The programming language used for developing the calculator.

*Tkinter: Pythonâ€™s standard GUI library used to build the calculator interface.

*Matplotlib: Used to plot mathematical graphs.

*Numpy: For advanced mathematical functions and calculations.
